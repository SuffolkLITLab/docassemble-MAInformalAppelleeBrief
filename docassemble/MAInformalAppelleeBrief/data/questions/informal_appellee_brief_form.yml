      An appeal is not a "do-over." An appeal is a review of a particular application of the law. You must appeal a specific legal error that you believe the trial court made. Errors can include the following:

      
      **Misrepresentation of legal precedent**: This occurs when the judge made a mistake about the law.

      
      **Reliance on evidence that should have been excluded**: This occurs when the judge either 
        - Did not allow you to prove something that you should have been allowed to prove.
        - Allowed the other side to prove something that they should not have been allowed to prove.

id: record appendix
question: |
  Upload your record appendix
subquestion: |
  If you are an appellee (responding to an appeal), you may file a record appendix that will be called the "supplemental appendix," containing copies of documents that were filed in or created by the trial court or agency, are not impounded, and are relevant to the Appeals Court's review of the issues raised on appeal, even if the document is also included in the appellant's record appendix.  There is a special procedure for filing impounded information that is described below and in section (d) (4) of the Informal Brief Guidance.

  Filing a supplemental appendix is not mandatory unless the document or testimony you are referring to in your informal appellee brief was not included in the appellant's record appendix or transcript(s).  If you are an appellee responding to an informal brief under this pilot program, you do not need permission to file a supplemental appendix, whether you are submitting an informal brief or a formal one.

  If a supplemental appendix is filed, it must be filed as a separate document from the informal appellee brief.  It is filed at the same time as when you file your appellee brief. The pages must be numbered consecutively with the cover page being page one, and the supplemental appendix must include a table of contents that lists by title each document it contains, and the page on which it begins.  A template is provided as part of this pilot program. A copy of a supplemental appendix must be served on each party in the case, with the service identified in your certificate of service. 

  Please note that only materials that were presented to the lower court or agency may be included in a supplemental appendix.  If you wish to include materials that were not presented to the lower court or agency, you must file a motion in the Appeals Court seeking permission to do so.  (Such motions are usually denied because the Appeals Court reviews the judge's decision based only on the information that was before the judge.

          record_appendix_text = "Could not extract text from the uploaded file."
  else:

id: impounded record appendix
question: |
  Upload your impounded record appendix 
subquestion: |
  In addition to information that is automatically impounded or confidential under a law or court rule, such as the names of children or victims of certain crimes or financial statements in a divorce or child support case, any information or document that was impounded in the trial court continues to be impounded in the Appeals Court.  You are responsible for finding out which if any such laws or rules apply in your case.

  Documents containing impounded information must be filed in a separate record appendix volume from the supplemental appendix if you choose to file one.  Any impounded supplemental appendix must have a cover stating it "Contains Impounded Material," must have consecutive page numbers with the cover page being page one, and must have a table of contents listing each document along with the page where it begins.  A template is provided as part of this pilot program.

  Documents that are not impounded but appear in a supplemental appendix and contain confidential or personal identifying information (PII) must be "redacted," which means the confidential information and PII is blacked out so it cannot be seen.  Examples of PII are Social Security numbers, taxpayer identification numbers, driver's license numbers, State-issued ID card numbers, passport numbers, financial account numbers, and credit or debit card numbers.
