      **Mistake of law**: This occurs when the judge made a mistake about the law or how to apply the law.
    
      **Reliance on evidence that should have been excluded**: This occurs when the judge either 
        - Did not allow you to prove something that you should have been allowed to prove.
        - Allowed the other side to prove something that they should not have been allowed to prove.

question: |
  Statement of the facts
subquestion: |
  You do not have to provide a statement of the facts that are related to the issues on appeal unless you want to or disagree with what the appellant wrote. If you state facts, each statement must be followed by a reference to the specific page or pages in the appellant's record appendix, transcript(s), or the supplemental appendix where that fact is found **(Examples -– "Apx at 25"; "Transcript 10/15/22 at pg 55"; "Exhibit #2 at pg 95")**.  
  
  You may not include facts that were not brought to the attention of the trial judge or agency, and you must refer to specific page(s) of that document unless the document or exhibit is a single page.  

  If you do not explain the facts with citations to the record appendices, the Appeals Court may not be able to identify what happened in the lower court. A complete description of the facts can take several pages to complete depending on the case. 
  
  Do not refer to any party or individual by name if their identity has been **impounded** by statute, court rule, or court order.

id: Argument
question: |
  Legal argument
subquestion: |
  The legal argument is an important section of your brief. Present your argument(s) why the Appeals Court should not overturn the decision of the trial court or agency.  You must support your argument(s) with citations to legal authorities such as case decisions (preferably from Massachusetts), statutes, regulations, court rules, constitutional provisions, or other authorities.  
  
  When discussing facts again in this section, you must include a reference to the specific page or pages in the appellant's record appendix, transcript(s), or supplemental appendix where support for that fact can be found.

id: record appendix
question: |
  Do you have your supplemental appendix?
subquestion: |
  As an appellee (responding to an appeal), you may file a record appendix that will be called the **"supplemental appendix,"** containing copies of documents that were filed in or created by the trial court or agency, are not impounded, **and are relevant to the Appeals Court's review of the issues raised on appeal, even if the document is also included in the appellant's record appendix.**  There is a special procedure for filing "impounded" information that is described later in the interview and in section (d) (4) of the Informal Brief Guidance below.

  Filing a supplemental appendix is not mandatory unless the document or testimony you are referring to in your informal appellee brief was not included in the appellant's record appendix or transcript(s). **This program will format and paginate your documents with a table of contents.**

  If a supplemental appendix is filed, it must be filed as a separate document from the informal appellee brief.  It is filed at the same time as when you file your appellee brief. A copy of a supplemental appendix must be served on each party in the case, with the service identified in your certificate of service. 

  If there is more than one volume of the supplemental record appendix, each volume must be numbered (example, vol. 1, vol. 2). The page numbers for each volume of appendix should restart, with the cover page being page one. A copy of each volume of the supplemental record appendix must be served on each party in the case, with the service identified in your certificate of service.

  Note that only materials that were presented to the lower court or agency may be included in a supplemental appendix.  If you wish to include materials that were not presented to the lower court or agency, you must file a motion in the Appeals Court seeking permission to do so. Such motions are usually denied because the Appeals Court reviews the judge's decision based only on the information that was before the judge.

id: impounded record appendix
question: |
  Do you have your impounded record appendix? 
subquestion: |
  In addition to information that is automatically impounded or confidential under a law or court rule, such as the names of children or victims of certain crimes or financial statements in a divorce or child support case, any information or document that was impounded in the trial court continues to be impounded in the Appeals Court. You are responsible for finding out which if any such laws or rules apply in your case.

  **Documents containing impounded information must be filed in a separate record appendix volume from the supplemental appendix if you choose to file one with a cover stating "Contains Impounded Material".** 
  
  Documents that are not impounded but appear in an appendix and contain confidential or personal identifying information (PII) must be "redacted," which means the confidential information and PII is blacked out so it cannot be seen.  Examples of PII are Social Security numbers, taxpayer identification numbers, driver's license numbers, State-issued ID card numbers, passport numbers, financial account numbers, and credit or debit card numbers.
