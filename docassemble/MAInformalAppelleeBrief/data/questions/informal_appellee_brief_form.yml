    Appellee informal brief
  description: |-
    The Appeals Court permits only self-represented parties (no lawyer) to file an informal brief. This interview will help you write an informal brief for filing with the Appeals Court. Check the Appeals Court's website for information about the informal brief pilot program.  
  can_I_use_this_form: |
    If you are replying to an appellant brief, you can use this interview to write an informal brief to the Appeals Court. 
  before_you_start: |
    You will need to know the following information to complete this interview:

    * The **Appeals Court** docket nuber for your case (has a "P", for example, 2024-P-1234). 
    * The **Trial Court** your case was decided in. 
    * The names of the plaintiff(s) and defendant(s) in your trial court case, and if they are represented by a lawyer, the lawyer's name and email or business mailing address. 
    * A copy of the brief sent to you by the appellant(s) or their attorney. 
    
    Recommendations:
  
    * First, organize your relevant lower court documents and upload them in this interview to create your record appendix. 
    * Second, when preparing your brief's facts, case history, and legal argument, use the pages of the record appendix to reference where the judges can find support for your facts. 
    * Third, use the "Sign in or register to save your progress" option available on each page to work on your brief. 

    Your Brief's Due Date:
  
    * Check with the Appeals Court for the current due date for your brief. 
    * If you need more time to finish and file your brief, you can file a motion with the Appeals Court to enlarge the time using the interview at https://courtformsonline.org/ma/forms/enlarge-time-to-file-appeals-court

    A brief for the Appeals Court is complicated and can take significant time to write and finish. Save your brief in this interview so you can return later and finish it.

      **Mistake of law**: This occurs when the judge made a mistake about the law or how to apply the law.

      
      **Reliance on evidence that should have been excluded**: This occurs when the judge either 
        - Did not allow you to prove something that you should have been allowed to prove.
        - Allowed the other side to prove something that they should not have been allowed to prove.

id: Challenged judgments
question: |
  Case History. What order(s), decision(s), and judgment of the lower court are you challenging?

If you do give a history, you must include references to the page(s) in the appellant's record appendix or your supplemental record appendix, which is described below, where evidence of each statement can be found.  You can include copies of documents that you are referring to in a supplemental record appendix, but you do not have to file a supplemental appendix or any documents that also appear in the appellant's record appendix.

  Your case's docket will identify the important dates, filings, orders and judges' names.

  Facts
subquestion: |
  You do not have to provide a statement of the facts that are related to the issues on appeal unless you want to or disagree with what the appellant wrote. If you state facts, each statement must be followed by a reference to the specific page or pages in the appellant's record appendix, transcript(s), or the supplemental appendix where that fact is found (Examples -– "Apx at 25"; "Transcript 10/15/22 at pg 55"; "Exhibit #2 at pg 95").  
  
  You may not include facts that were not brought to the attention of the trial judge or agency or cite generally to an entire document by its title or exhibit number without referring to specific page(s) of that document, unless the document or exhibit is a single page.  

  If you do not explain the facts with citations to the record appendix, the Appeals Court may not be able to identify what happened in the lower court. A complete description of the facts can take several pages to complete depending on the case. Your entire brief is allowed to be 30 pages total. 
  
  It is your obligation to find out if any information in your case is impounded or confidential. For more information, go to section (c) (4) of the [Informal Brief Guidance](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/appeals-court-informal-brief-pilot-program).

  Legal Argument
subquestion: |
  The legal argument is an important section of your brief. Present your argument(s) why the Appeals Court should not overturn the decision of the trial court or agency.  You must support your argument(s) with citations to legal authorities such as case decisions (preferably from Massachusetts), statutes, regulations, court rules, constitutional provisions, or other authorities.  
  
  When discussing facts again in this section, you must include a reference to the specific page or pages in the appellant's record appendix, transcript(s), or supplemental appendix where support for that fact can be found. For guidance on how to cite legal sources in Massachusetts, reference this [guide](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/massachusetts-legal-writing-and-citations).

id: record appendix
question: |
  Do you have your record appendix?
subquestion: |
  If you are an appellee (responding to an appeal), you may file a record appendix that will be called the **"supplemental appendix,"** containing copies of documents that were filed in or created by the trial court or agency, are not impounded, **and are relevant to the Appeals Court's review of the issues raised on appeal, even if the document is also included in the appellant's record appendix.**  There is a special procedure for filing "impounded" information that is described below and in section (d) (4) of the Informal Brief Guidance.

  Filing a supplemental appendix is not mandatory unless the document or testimony you are referring to in your informal appellee brief was not included in the appellant's record appendix or transcript(s).  If you are an appellee responding to an informal brief under this pilot program, you do not need permission to file a supplemental appendix, whether you are submitting an informal brief or a formal one.

  If a supplemental appendix is filed, it must be filed as a separate document from the informal appellee brief.  It is filed at the same time as when you file your appellee brief. The pages must be numbered consecutively with the cover page being page one, and the supplemental appendix must include a table of contents that lists by title each document it contains, and the page on which it begins.  A template is provided as part of this pilot program. A copy of a supplemental appendix must be served on each party in the case, with the service identified in your certificate of service. 

  Please note that only materials that were presented to the lower court or agency may be included in a supplemental appendix.  If you wish to include materials that were not presented to the lower court or agency, you must file a motion in the Appeals Court seeking permission to do so.  (Such motions are usually denied because the Appeals Court reviews the judge's decision based only on the information that was before the judge.

id: impounded record appendix
question: |
  Do you have your impounded record appendix? 
subquestion: |
  In addition to information that is automatically impounded or confidential under a law or court rule, such as the names of children or victims of certain crimes or financial statements in a divorce or child support case, any information or document that was impounded in the trial court continues to be impounded in the Appeals Court.  You are responsible for finding out which if any such laws or rules apply in your case.

  Documents containing impounded information must be filed in a separate record appendix volume from the supplemental appendix if you choose to file one.  Any impounded supplemental appendix must have a cover stating it "Contains Impounded Material," must have consecutive page numbers with the cover page being page one, and must have a table of contents listing each document along with the page where it begins.  A template is provided as part of this pilot program.

  Documents that are not impounded but appear in a supplemental appendix and contain confidential or personal identifying information (PII) must be "redacted," which means the confidential information and PII is blacked out so it cannot be seen.  Examples of PII are Social Security numbers, taxpayer identification numbers, driver's license numbers, State-issued ID card numbers, passport numbers, financial account numbers, and credit or debit card numbers.
